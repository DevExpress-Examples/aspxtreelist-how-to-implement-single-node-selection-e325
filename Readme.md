# ASPxTreeList - How to implement single node selection


<p>This tutorial demonstrates how single node selection can be implemented. In this sample, parent node selection is disabled, and end-users are allowed to select only one leaf node within the ASPxTreeList control.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you wish to have recursive selection enabled, it is necessary to additionally disable the ViewState by setting EnableViewState to False. You can find a sample in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T155666">ASPxTreeList - How to allow only one root node to be selected (Recursive = true)</a> ticket.</p>
